This folder contains an implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm for integer routing.
The algorithm is based on a procedure to sample self avoiding walks, whose implementation is in the saw_sampler_core.py file.
The simulated annealing algorithm is implemented in the simulated_annealing_core.py file.
The file example_anealing_optimizer.ipynb contains an example of how to use the simulated annealing algorithm to solve a routing problem.


Requirements for greedy_core.py:
- Python 3.6 or higher
