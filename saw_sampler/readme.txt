This folder contains a python implementation of the algorithm to sample self avoiding walks on a graph.

The file saw_sampler_core.py contains the core implementation of the algorithm. 
The file example_saw_sampler.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the algorithm to sample self avoiding walks on random regular graphs. It also contains the notation and the explanation of the algorithm.
The file example_grid_saw_sampler.ipynb is a jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the algorithm to sample self avoiding walks on a 2d grid. It also contains the notation and the explanation of the algorithm.
