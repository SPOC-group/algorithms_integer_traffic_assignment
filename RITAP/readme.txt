This folder contains an implementation of the RITAP algorithm to solve the integer traffic assignment problem (ITAP)
RITAP is based on relaxing ITAP to TAP (traffic assignment problem) and solving it using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
File RITAP_core.py contains the implementation of the RITAP algorithm.
File example_RITAP.ipynb contains an example of how to use the RITAP algorithm.

Requirements for RITAP_core.py:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Numpy
- Networkx
- Networkit
- copy
- time

Additional Requirements for example_RITAP.ipynb:
- matplotlib
